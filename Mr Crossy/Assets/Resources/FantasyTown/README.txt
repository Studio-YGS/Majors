Thank you for purchasing the Fantasy Town Kit. 

This package uses linear color space (Edit->Project Settings->Player->Color Space) and the deferred render path (Edit->Project Settings->Graphics->Rendering Path). 
Please change your project settings accordingly.
Also make sure you bake the Occlusion Culling (Window->Occlusion Culling->Bake).

This package makes use of a few scripts to improve the look, performance and usability.

Changing the wall and roof materials of a building can be a tedious task due to the modular approach of the buildings. 
To change a wall or roof material of a building find the MaterialSettings gameobject most buildings contain under the logic+lights gameobject. 
Here you can change the materials for a whole building. 
The materials have to follow a certain naming convention (underscore+typ of material) to work properly.

You can change the Theme not only at run time but also in the editor. To change the theme in the editor find the ChangeThemeInEditor gameobject located under Logic+UI gameobject.
Enable the checkbox of your desired theme (in case more than one checkbox is enabled the last theme will be applied). You might have to run the scene to take change full effect.

The find out more about the logic in the scene consult comments in the scripts. If you have any questions don't hesitate to contact us.

Enjoy the the Fantasy Town Kit.
